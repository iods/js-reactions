This is a resource for referencing various frameworks for building projects in React. It stresses
the time it takes when considering components that will improve functionality. Additionally, it is
never a good idea to write code already available to you.

> A framework is a platform that provides a foundation for developing software
> applications. Think of it as a template of a working program that can be
> selectively modified by adding code. It uses shared resources such as libraries,
> image files, and reference documents and puts them together in one package.
